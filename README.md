# NHL Game Prediction Model

The code here is for creating a model that predicts the outcome of a single NHL game. Using this model we can get the probability that the home and away teams have of winning that matchup. The methodology behind the model can be found [here](http://harryshomer.com/2018/09/21/nhl-game-prediction-model.html). 

## Running

All the data used in the analysis is provided in order to verify the conclusions stated in the previous post. The models can be created by running the build_models.py file in the models directory (this will also print the evaluation metrics). 

For those looking to run it yourself I recommend looking at the blog post and the code for the variables needed for each game.
